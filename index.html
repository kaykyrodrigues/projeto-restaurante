        <h2>ABOUT US</h2>
        <p>Founded in 1985 by Miguel and Isabella Rivera, Tropical Restaurant started as a small beachside café in a quiet coastal town. Inspired by their Caribbean heritage, the couple crafted a menu filled with vibrant flavors, fresh seafood, and tropical fruits. Word quickly spread about their delicious dishes and warm hospitality, turning the restaurant into a local favorite.</p>
        <p>Over the years, Tropical Restaurant expanded, keeping its signature charm while welcoming visitors from around the world. Today, it remains a beloved spot where guests can enjoy authentic island cuisine, live music, and the spirit of paradise in every bite.</p>
